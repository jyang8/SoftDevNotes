Aim: Requesting assistance
Do Now: Write an html file that contains a form with a single text box and a submit button.
Write a flask app where the root rout renders the html form as a template.

Multiple routes can go to the same location.

import request

request -> response

"GET /main/ HTTP/1.1" 200 - (request/response)
E.g.
404 -- file not found
301 -- redirect
503 -- service unavailable

print request -- Good way to debug

When you print out an object, it is automatically put into "< >".
E.g.
<Flask 'app'>

print request.headers

request.args
request.args['stuff']
