Cookie & Sessions
       Cookies are files that websites will save to your web browser to store information on a local machine.
       Useful for keeping track of persistent information like login credentials.

       Sessions
	     Flask sessions are securely signed cookies.
	     Since they are encrypted, they cannot be modified by the user of the local machine.
	     The sessions object works exactly like a dictionary.
	     	 Add data to a session:
		    session[KEY] = DATA
		 Remove data from a session:
		    session.pop(KEY)
