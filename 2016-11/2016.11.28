Aim: After being framed, you might need to take a REST

Tips for using frameworks

    Many files have .min equivalents, which contains the same code without any 
    extra formatting.

    jquery is a popular javascript library used in many frameworks.

    The order in which you include javascript files is important.

    
    E.g.
        <script src="jquery-3.1.1.js"></script> 
	<script src="bootstrap/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>	

	**If not in the correct order:
	Uncaught Error:	Bootstrap's JavaScript requires jQuery**

    Javascript in <head> or at the end of <body>?

        Yet another programmer holy war

	**<head>: slow because it has to download a lot of content**
	**<body>: some elements do not respond because JavaScript has not 
	downloaded**
	**The trend now is end of <body>**

REST APIs

    API (Application Program Interface)

        A published set of protocols that can be used to have your program 
	interact with another program/service. 	

    REST (Representational State Transfer)

        APIs that transmit data back after receiving an http[s] GET request.

	Returned data can be in various formats, most common are html, xml, json

        Example REST call:
