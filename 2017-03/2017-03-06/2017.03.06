Aim: Capturing bubbles.
DN: Create an html/js program with the following features
    An html file with an svg element and a "clear" button
    A js function that will create and return a circle svg element
    A js function that will call the function above and add the returned circle to the svg element
    Attach this draw circle function to the svg element

javascript event propagation

    Events initially propagate downward from the top most node in the DOM tree to the target element.
    This is known as event capturing.

    After an event reaches its target, it then propagates back up the DOM tree.
    This is known as event bubling

    By default, event listeners do not trigger until the event bubbling phase.
