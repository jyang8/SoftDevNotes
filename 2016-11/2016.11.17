Aim: Stay classy, css.

div tag

    <div> is a container element. Its sole purpose is to define a section of
    your page that should be considered grouped together.

class attribute

    All html elements can have a class attribute. It is an identifier that can
    be applied to multiple elements.

    <div class="navbar"> ... </div>
    <h2 class="new_chapter bold"> ... </h2>
    **Spaces mean you apply multiple classes to the selector.**

    Classes can be used as CSS selectors by putting a . before the class name.

        .new_chapter {
	    font-family: "Times New Roman", Times, serif;
	    text-align: center;
	}
	**The reason there are quotes for "Times New Roman" is because it has
	spaces in its name.**

id attributes

    All html elements can have an id attribute. It is an identifier that should
    only be applied to a single element.

    <div id="main_content"> ... </div>

    id names can be used in <a> tags as the href target

        <a href="#main_content"> ... </a>

    ids can be used as selectors by putting a # before the id name

    	#main_content {
       	    border: 2px solid goldenrod; **size, style, color in that order**
	}
