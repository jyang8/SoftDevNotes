javascript path functions

    Paths are used to draw arbitrary shapes, including circles and curves

    A context can keep track of one path at a time

    The path is not drawn until stroke() is called

    A path is considered done when a new beginPath() is called

        beginPath()
	    Starts or resets the current path

	moveTo(X, Y)
	    Moves the path to position (x, y), does not result in a line or a filled in section

	lineTo(X, Y)
	    Moves the path to position (x, y), will result in a line and a filled in section

	closePath()
	    Results in a line from the current position to the starting position

	    The path can be continued after

	stroke()
	    Renders all the lines in the path, does not end the path

	fill()
	    Fills the interior of the path, will not work if the path has fewer than 3 points in it

	arc(X, Y, RADIUS, START, END)
	    Creates an arc path with center (X, Y) with START and END as the defining angles in radians
	    **The arc is drawn clockwise**

> var ctx = document.getElementById('drawing').getContext('2d');

> ctx.beginPath();

> ctx.moveTo(250, 150);

> ctx.lineTo(250, 250);

> ctx.lineTo(100, 25);

> ctx.stroke();
