Aim: Don't forget to include POSTage
Do Now: Open up your form flask app from yesterday.

request object
	Stores information about incoming requests.

	Notable fields

		request.headers
			HTML headers sent from the browser

		request.method
			The request method (GET or POST)

		request.args
			The arguments in a query string from a GET request

		request.form
			The arguments sent in a POST request

		**request.args and request.form are immutable dictionaries

By default, only GET is enabled, not POST. (405 -- method not allowed)
You must add to the decorator to enable POST.
    E.g.
	@app.route("/authenticate/", methods=["POST"]) **Enables POST/Disables GET.
	@app.route("/authenticate/", methods=["GET","POST"]) **Enables GET/POST

**Besides GET and POST, there is also PUT.

**BAD REQUEST: request.args from POST or request.form from GET (wrong methods)
