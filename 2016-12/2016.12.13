javascript

    Programming language originally designed to augment html and be run locally on a web browser.

    No direct relationship with java, though both have similar syntax.

    Dynamically typed - variable types are provided at runtime (like python).

    Most development will be done through a web browser's console.

    console.log()

        There is no built in i/o. console.log() will display a string to the console.

    C-style syntax

    Variable basics

        var x = 4;
	var b = true;
	var s = "hello";
	var l = [4, 3, 19];
	var o = { 'a' : 10, 'x' : 'hello' }; // object or associative array (aka dictionary) **KEYS MUST BE STRINGS**

    E.g.
	// assignment operations return what is being assigned, but not declaration operations
        > var x = 5;
	<
	> x = 19;
	< 19
	> x = [1, 2, 5]
	< x.length
	> 3

Document Object Model (DOM)

    javascript derives most of its utility through being able to interact with html and xml documents.

    The DOM is an API for interacting with html. It provides a structure that we can interact with and can be manipulated by functions.

    Pages are represented as trees.

    Selecting HTML elements

        document.getElementById(<ID>)

	document.getElementsByTagName(<TAG>)

	document.getElementsByClassName(<CLASS>)
