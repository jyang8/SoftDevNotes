Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)

    Created to separate the presentation of an html/xml page and its content.
    **Interpreted by browsers slightly differently**
    
    Basic syntax:

        PROPERTY: VALUE;

	color: lightsteelblue; **text color**
	text-align: center;
	border: 10px; **no space between number and unit**

    There are 3 ways to incorporate CSS into a page:
    inline, internal style sheet, external style sheet.

    Inline CSS
    
        Add CSS code to the style attribute of a tag

	<TAG style="CSS CODE">

	<p style="color: green; font-size: 2em;"> ... </p> 
	**em is a proportional unit for font-size**

    Internal Style Sheet

        Add a <style> element to the <head> section of the page.
	Include all your CSS code inside the <style> ... </style> block.

	Internal and External style sheets require the addition of a selector so
	that it is clear what element you are styling.

	SELECTOR {
	    CSS CODE
	}

	h1 {
	    color: ##FF00FF;
	}

    External Style Sheets

        Create a separate .css file that contains all your CSS code.
	It cannot contain any other kind of code, including html or xml.

	Include a link to the css file inside the <head> section of your page.

	<head>
	    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="STYLE FILE">
	    ...
	</head>
	**link means you bring in code from an external file**
