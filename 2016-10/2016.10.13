Relational database
    Database that stores information as a collection of tables.
    Field: Column data in a RDB
    Record: Row in a RDB
    Data can be linked between tables based on field values.

    	     	       School Database
		          Students
		   name       |       sid
		   lorenz     	      0   
		   jerry	      1   
		   kate		      2

		   	   Classes
	   name       |      sid      |      grade
	   softdev    	     0 	      	     60
	   softdev	     1		     80
	   system	     1		     90

SQL (Structured Query Language)
    Standard language designed to work with relational databases.
    Is used for many major db programs, though the implementations may not (mostly are not) compatible.
    MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Oracle are different SQL implementations.

SQLite
    SQL implementation that relies entirely on function calls in the parent program. There is no database server.
    All database information is stored in a single file.
    Data is dynamically typed as values are inserted into a table.

Basic SQLite Operations
    CREATE TABLE
        Add a table to a database.
	CREATE TABLE <name> ( <column name> <data type>, ... )
	    The data type will help to convert entered values to a suggested type.
	    TEXT, INTEGER, REAL, NUMERIC, BLOB
	        NUMERIC will default to an integer, but can be a floating point.
		BLOB means no suggested type.
	    Columns can be given a PRIMARY KEY attribute, denoting that every entry in that column is unique and cannot be NULL.
	    Columns can be given a NOT NULL attribute, denoting that no entry can be NULL.
	INSERT INTO
	    Insert a record into a table.
	    INSERT INTO <name> VALUES ( <field 1>, <field 2>, ... )
	        <missing notes> Will add a record to a table matching the values.

SQLite Shell Commands
    .quit
    .tables
    .header on | off
    .mode column | csv | list | html | insert | line | tabs
		
E.g.

$ sqlite3 school.db
sqlite> .tables
sqlite> CREATE TABLE students ( name TEXT, sid INTEGER );
sqlite> .tables
students
sqlite> CREATE TABLE classes ( name TEXT PRIMARY KEY, sid INTEGER NOT NULL, grade REAL );
sqlite> .tables
classes students
sqlite> INSERT INTO students VALUES ("lorenz", 0);
sqlite> INSERT INTO classes VALUES ("softdev", 0, 60);
sqlite> .headers on
