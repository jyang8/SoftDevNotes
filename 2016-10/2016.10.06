Aim: Url binding is the art of redirection

Sessions
	The session object works exactly like a dictionary
	    Add data to a session:
	    	session[KEY] = DATA
	    Remove data from a session:
	    	session.pop(KEY)

	In order for the session to be encrypted, we need to set a private key in our app:
	   APP.secret_key = <RANDOM STRING>
	        good way to get random data: os.urandom(32)
		     Returns 32 random bits of data as a string

	**Must import session to use it

url_for
	Flask function that will build the correct url for a particular function.
	syntax: url_for( <FUNCTION> )

redirect
	Flask function that will redirect a call to one route to a different response.
	Often used in combination with url_for.
	E.g. return redirect( url_for('login') )
