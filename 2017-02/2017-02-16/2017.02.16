Aim: Let's Get Animated

Do Now:
    Create an html/js combo with a function that draws a circle on a canvas.
    Call the function at the end of your js file.


What we won't be using for animation
    set Interval

What we will be using
    requestAnimationFrame

Why?
    requestAnimationFrame tells the browser to run a
    specified function before drawing the next frame.

    The browser will attempt to run ~60 frames per second.

    It lets the browser handle when the code should be
    executed (as opposed to setInterval which is based
    on specific times).

    It also lets the browser pause animation when a page
    is not in the foreground.
