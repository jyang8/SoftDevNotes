Aim: Functioning tools

No functional programming toolbox would be complete without
the following concepts:

    Memoization, Map, Filter, Reduce

        Reducing the time it takes to complete an (often recursive)
	algorithm by saving previously computed values to be used later.

	Can be easily created using decorators.

	def memoize(f):
	    vals = {}
	    def inner(*arg):
	    	if arg[0] not in vals:
		    vals[arg[0]] = f(*arg)
		return vals[arg[0]]
	    return inner
