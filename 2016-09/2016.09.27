Aim: Flask: serving artisanal web pages since 2010.

"/occupations" vs "/occupations/" (compatibility issues on various browsers)

FIle Paths and the Flask Server

When a flask app runs, the directory where the flask file exists is considered the root directory of the web server.

Paths for files opened by the app or supporting modules should be based on that root.


flask_jobs/
	app.py
	utils/ **conventional name**
		occupations.py
	templates/ ***special name***
	data/ **conventional name**
		occupations.csv
	static/ ***special name*** (files in this directory are automatically served by the flask server; must be at the root directory--same as app.py)
