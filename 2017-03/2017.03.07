Event Propagation

    1. An element intercepts an event

    2. Browser collects DOM node path of the event from the starting element to the root

    3. Capture: The event propagates down the path from step 2

    4. Bubble: The event propagates up the path from step 2

**EVENT LISTENERS ARE TRIGGERED AT THE BUBBLING STEP**
Adding true to an event listener changes the event triggering to the capturing phase.
