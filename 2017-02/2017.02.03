Aim: Mongo likes py

Working with pymongo

    from pymongo import MongoClient

    Connecting to a mongodb server and database

        server = MongoClient(<IP>)

    To access databases and collections, you can use either [] or .

        db = server['mydb']
	db = server.mydb

	c = db['students'] #db.students

    Databases and collections are not created until a document has been added to them!
    **called lazy**

    To add a document

        1. Create a dictionary
	2. Insert it to the collection

	    doc = { 'name' : 'bob', 'age' : 65 }

	    c.insert_one( doc )

	You can insert a list of documents with insert_many()


e.g.

    >>> from pymongo import MongoClient

    >>> server = MongoClient('149.89.150.100')
    **Computer is always 127.0.0.1**

    >>> server
    MongoClient(host=['149.89.150.100:27017'], document_class=dict, tz_aware=False, connect=True)

    >>> db = server.mydb

    >>> db
    Database(MongoClient(MongoClient(host=['149.89.150.100:27017'], document_class=dict, tz_aware=False, connect=True), u'mydb')

    >>> students = db.students

    >>> students
    Collection(Database(MongoClient(MongoClient(host=['149.89.150.100:27017'], document_class=dict, tz_aware=False, connect=True), u'mydb'), u'students')

    >>> students.count()
    0

    >>> db.students.count()
    0

    >>> doc = { 'name' : 'bob', 'age' : 65 }

    >>> students.insert_one( doc )
    <pymongo.results.InsertOneResult object at >

    >>>
