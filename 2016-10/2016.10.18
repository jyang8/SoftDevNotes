Aim: WHERE did I put that data?
Do Now: Using the database from the last assignment, write SELECT statements to do the following:
    1. Generate a table containing course codes and grades
        sqlite> SELECT code, mark FROM courses;
    2. Generate a table with student names, id, and grades
        sqlite> SELECT name, students.id, mark FROM students, courses;

WHERE
    Allows you to put restrictions on the results of a SELECT statement.
    SELECT * FROM courses WHERE mark < 65;
    **You can use the operators and, or**

    sqlite> SELECT name, code, mark
    ...> FROM students, courses
    ...> WHERE students.id = courses.id and mark < 65;
    name        code        mark
