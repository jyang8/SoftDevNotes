Aim: Defeating the Trojans with the help of Ajax

AJAX
    Asynchronous Javascript And Xml

    System created to send data to a server in the background of a page without
    having to reload the page or wait for the server to acknowledge the change.

    It is a combination of technologies including javascript, html, DOM and XML.

    AJAX calls can send data to a server using GET and POST (for example), and then
    catch the data sent by the server in response.

    Originally, XML was the only supported format for sending/receiving data, but
    now many formats are used, including JSON and plain text.

    AJAX calls can be made via the XMLHttpRequest javascript object.

    **
    E.g.
	document.getElementById("h"); *DOM object*

	becomes

	$("h") *jquery-DOM object*
    **

    Using jquery for AJAX

        The jquery library provides clean wrapper functions for making AJAX calls.

	$.ajax( <SETTINGS> );

	    Settings is an associative array containing all the information
	    required to make the given ajax call.

	    Notable settings keys:

	        url : Server target link

		type : Method ("POST" or "GET")

		data : Data to be sent

		success : Function to be called if the server responds

		    This function can take an argument if the server sends data
		    in response.

            $.ajax ({
	        url: '/foo',
		type: 'GET',
		data: "look it's information!",
		success: function(d) {
			  console.log( d );
		}
	    });
